#### PROJECT GOAL: Brain Stroke Prediction
One of the top 5  leading causes of death today is stroke, according to the CDC. It is important people know and understand how different health concerns might impact the probability of them having a stroke. We are able to create a model which will allow us to predict the likelihood of  a patient to have a stroke based on input parameters.

#### PROCESS:
1.  Find data source(s)
2.  Data (ETL) and Data Delivery:
* Clean Data
* Pre-process Data
2.	Analyze Data:
* Create Model
* Train the model
* Test the Model
* Optimize the Model
* Create a machine learning algorithm
3.  Visualizations:
* Create index.html
* Create app.py
* Create style.css/plot.js/static.js
4.  Presentation:
* Create a Readme File
* Create slide deck which includes charts/graphs/maps/image

## Data Source
 * Stroke Prediction Dataset
